# File Permissions & Ownership in Linux  

Linux is a **multi-user system**. File permissions and ownership control **who can read, write, or execute** a file or directory.

## ðŸ”¹ Ownership  

Every file in Linux has:  
- **User (Owner):** The person who created the file.  
- **Group:** A collection of users who may share access.  
- **Others:** Everyone else on the system.  

You can see ownership info with:  
```bash
ls -l
