# Linux – Introduction

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. 
It powers servers, desktops, mobile devices (Android), routers, IoT, and most of the world’s 
critical infrastructure.

## Why Learn Linux?
- Most servers and cybersecurity tools run on Linux.
- Linux gives complete control of the system, unlike Windows/macOS.
- It’s essential for penetration testing, system administration, and cybersecurity research.

## High-Level Structure
- **Kernel**: the core that communicates with hardware.
- **Shell**: interface between the user and kernel.
- **File System**: everything is treated as a file (devices, directories, sockets).
- **Processes**: tasks running in the background or foreground.

## First Commands
```bash
uname -a         # View system/kernel information
whoami           # Show current user
pwd              # Show current directory
ls               # List files
man <command>    # Learn about any command
